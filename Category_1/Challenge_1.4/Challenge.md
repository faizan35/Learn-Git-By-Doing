# Challenge 1.4: Git Hooks for Advanced Workflow Automation

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, you'll explore Git hooks and their role in automating and enhancing your workflow. Git hooks are scripts that can be triggered at various points in the Git workflow, allowing you to automate tasks like code linting, testing, and more.

## Challenge Tasks

1. Open your terminal and navigate to a directory with a Git repository.

2. Familiarize yourself with the concept of Git hooks and understand the various types of hooks available, such as pre-commit, post-commit, pre-push, and more.

3. Identify a task or series of tasks in your project workflow that can benefit from automation using Git hooks. This could include running code linters, performing tests, or notifying team members of specific actions.

4. Create a Git hook script tailored to the task you've identified. Ensure that the script is placed in the appropriate Git hooks directory in your project.

5. Document the purpose and functionality of your Git hook, as well as any prerequisites or configurations needed for it to run successfully.

6. Test the Git hook by performing actions that should trigger it, such as making commits, pushing changes, or other relevant actions.

7. Reflect on how the Git hook has improved your workflow by automating tasks and enhancing efficiency.

8. Optional: Share your experiences with using Git hooks for workflow automation and discuss potential use cases with others.

## Additional Notes

- Git hooks are a powerful tool for automating tasks and enforcing workflows in your projects.

- Each Git hook type has a specific purpose and can be customized to suit your project's needs.
