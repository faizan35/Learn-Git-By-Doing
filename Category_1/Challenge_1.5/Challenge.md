# Challenge 1.5: Conflict Resolution Across Multiple Branches

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, you'll delve into resolving conflicts that may arise when merging changes from multiple branches. Conflicts can occur when two or more branches have made conflicting changes to the same file or code. You'll learn to navigate and resolve these conflicts efficiently.

## Challenge Tasks

1. Open your terminal and navigate to a directory with a Git repository that contains multiple branches.

2. Create two or more branches and make conflicting changes to a file or code. These changes should create merge conflicts when merging the branches.

3. Attempt to merge these branches, and when conflicts are encountered, resolve them using the appropriate Git commands.

4. Document the conflicting changes made in the branches, the conflict resolution process, and the final state of the code after conflicts are resolved.

5. Test the code to ensure that it functions correctly after conflict resolution.

6. Reflect on the importance of conflict resolution in Git and how it helps maintain code quality and project integrity.

7. Optional: Share your experiences with resolving conflicts across multiple branches and discuss strategies for preventing conflicts in collaborative projects.

## Additional Notes

- Conflict resolution is a fundamental skill in Git, enabling collaboration and maintaining code quality.

- Efficient conflict resolution can prevent code inconsistencies and improve project integrity.

- Don't forget to refer to the [Category 1: Intermediate Git Commands](../../about_1.md) section for an overview of all the challenges in this category.

## Challenge Submission

After completing the challenge, create a new file inside the "Challenge_1.5" directory named "[Solution.md](./Solution.md)." Inside this file, include documentation for the Git hook script you created, its purpose, functionality, and any relevant configurations.

You can then commit and push your changes to your fork of the repository. Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or need assistance.
