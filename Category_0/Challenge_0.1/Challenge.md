# Challenge 0.1: Initializing a Git Repository

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, you'll learn how to initialize a new Git repository from scratch and understand the basic Git commands involved in this process. The goal is to set up a new Git repository for a project and perform the initial steps required to manage the project's version control.

## Challenge Tasks

1. Create a new directory on your local machine. You can name it anything you like.

2. Initialize a new Git repository in the created directory using the `git init` command.

3. Add a new file to the repository. You can create a simple text file.

4. Check the status of your repository using the `git status` command.

5. Stage the changes for your file using the `git add` command.

6. Commit your changes with an informative commit message using the `git commit` command.

7. View the commit history of your repository using the `git log` command.
