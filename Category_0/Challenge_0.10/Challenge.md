# Challenge 0.10: Tagging Commits

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, you'll learn how to create and manage Git tags, which are used to mark specific commits as significant milestones in your project's history. Git tags are commonly used to label releases, versions, or important points in your project's development.

## Challenge Tasks

1. Open your terminal and navigate to a directory with a Git repository.

2. View the commit history of the repository. Identify a specific commit that you want to tag as a significant milestone.

3. Create an annotated tag for the chosen commit using. Provide a descriptive tag name and an informative tag message.

4. Create additional tags for other significant commits in the repository, each with a descriptive name and message.

5. Use the git show command to view the details of a specific tag and the associated commit.
6. Reflect on the use of tags in Git and how they help mark important milestones and versions.
7. Optional: Experiment with lightweight tags and explore how they differ from annotated tags.

## Additional Notes

- Tags serve as markers for specific commits, making it easier to reference important points in your project's history.

- Annotated tags include a tag message, providing more context about the tagged commit.

- Don't forget to refer to the [Category 0: Fundamental Git Commands](../about_0.md) section for an overview of all the challenges in this category.

## Challenge Submission

After completing the challenge, create a new directory inside the "Category_0.10" directory (if not already provided) with a name "Solution" (e.g., "[Solution.md](./Solution.md)"). Inside this directory, include your solution files, such as the Git commands you used and the final state of your Git repository.

You can then commit and push your changes to your fork of the repository. Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or need assistance
