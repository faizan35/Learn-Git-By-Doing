# Challenge 0.7: Creating and Switching Branches

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, you'll learn how to create new branches using the `git branch` and `git checkout` commands. The goal is to understand the importance of branching in Git and how to work with multiple branches in a Git repository.

## Challenge Tasks

1. Open your terminal and navigate to a directory with a Git repository.

2. Use the `git branch` command to list the existing branches in the repository. Observe the current branch (usually indicated with an asterisk).

3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name **"feature-branch"**.

4. Use the git branch command again to confirm that the new branch has been created. The new branch should be listed in the branch list.

5. Switch to the newly created branch, **"feature-branch"**.
6. Create or modify a text file within the repository to make changes specific to the new branch.

7. Commit the changes on that branch with an informative commit message.

8. Use the git log command to view the commit history and confirm that your new commit is associated with the new branch.

9. Reflect on the significance of branching in Git for parallel development and feature isolation.

## Additional Notes

- Branching allows for parallel development, enabling multiple contributors to work on separate features or bug fixes without affecting the main project.

- Understanding how to create and switch between branches is fundamental to managing Git projects efficiently.

- Don't forget to refer to the [Category 0: Fundamental Git Commands](../about_0.md) section for an overview of all the challenges in this category.

## Challenge Submission

After completing the challenge, create a new directory inside the "Category_0.7" directory (if not already provided) with a name "Solution" (e.g., "[Solution.md](./Solution.md)"). Inside this directory, include your solution files, such as the Git commands you used and the final state of your Git repository.

You can then commit and push your changes to your fork of the repository. Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or need assistance
