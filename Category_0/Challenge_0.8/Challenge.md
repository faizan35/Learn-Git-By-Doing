# Challenge 0.8: Merging and Resolving Conflicts

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, you'll learn how to merge changes from one branch into another using the `git merge` command. Additionally, you'll practice resolving conflicts that may arise during the merging process. The goal is to understand how to bring changes from one branch into another while handling conflicting changes.

## Challenge Tasks

1. Open your terminal and navigate to a directory with a Git repository.

2. Switch to another branch where you want to merge your changes. This could be the master branch or another branch and merge the changes from your working branch into the target branch.

3. What are merge conflicts.?
4. How to resolve conflicts.?

5. Optional: Experiment with different merge strategies and explore Git's merge conflict tools.

## Additional Notes

- Merging is a fundamental Git operation that allows you to integrate changes from one branch into another. Conflicts may occur when changes in both branches affect the same lines of code.

- Resolving conflicts is a critical skill in collaborative development, ensuring that code changes are harmonized.

- Don't forget to refer to the [Category 0: Fundamental Git Commands](../about_0.md) section for an overview of all the challenges in this category.
