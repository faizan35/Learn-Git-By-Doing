# Challenge 0.4: Checking Repository Status

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, you'll learn how to use the `git status` command to check the status of your Git repository. The goal is to understand how to identify modified files, untracked files, and the current branch's status.

## Challenge Tasks

1. Open your terminal and navigate to a directory where you have a Git repository.

2. Use the `git status` command to check the status of your repository. Take note of the information provided, including untracked files, modified files, and the branch you are currently on.

3. Create a new text file in your repository directory and check the repository status again using `git status`. Observe how the new file is displayed in the status output.

4. Stage the changes to the new file using `git add` and check the repository status again.

5. Commit the staged changes with an informative commit message using `git commit`.

6. Use `git status` once more to ensure that your repository is clean and has no pending changes.

7. Optionally, experiment with other options and flags available with the `git status` command.

## Additional Notes

- The `git status` command is a valuable tool for tracking the current state of your Git repository, helping you understand what changes are ready to be committed and what files are untracked.

- Don't forget to refer to the [Category 0: Fundamental Git Commands](../about_0.md) section for an overview of all the challenges in this category.

## Challenge Submission

After completing the challenge, create a new directory inside the "Category_0.4" directory (if not already provided) with a name "Solution" (e.g., "[Solution.md](./Solution.md)"). Inside this directory, include your solution files, such as the Git commands you used and the final state of your Git repository.

You can then commit and push your changes to your fork of the repository. Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or need assistance
