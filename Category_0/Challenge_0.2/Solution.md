# Challenge 0.2: Cloning a Git Repository - Solution

In this solution, we'll walk through the process of cloning an existing Git repository from a remote source and completing the tasks outlined in the challenge description.

## Solution Steps

1. **Find a Public Repository**: To start, find a public Git repository on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket that you'd like to clone. For this example, we'll use the "ExampleRepository" on GitHub.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Use the `git clone` command to clone the chosen repository, providing its URL:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/ExampleRepository.git
   ```
