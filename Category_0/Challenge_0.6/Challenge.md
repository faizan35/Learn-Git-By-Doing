# Challenge 0.6: Viewing Commit History

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, you'll learn how to use the `git log` command to view the commit history of a Git repository. The goal is to understand how to explore the commit history, including commit messages, authors, dates, and commit hashes.

## Challenge Tasks

1. Open your terminal and navigate to a directory with a Git repository.

2. Use the `git log` command to view the commit history of the repository. Observe the list of commits, including commit messages, authors, dates, and commit hashes.

3. Use the `git log` command to display the commit history for a specific branch, tag, or commit hash. Compare the histories of different branches or versions.

4. Identify a specific commit in the history and use its commit hash to view detailed information about that commit.

5. Experiment with different options and flags available with the `git log` command, such as limiting the number of displayed commits, showing commit details, and formatting the output.

## Additional Notes

- The commit history provides a detailed record of all changes made to a Git repository, making it a valuable resource for tracking project development and identifying specific changes.

- Experimenting with different options of `git log` can help you tailor the output to your needs and gain a deeper understanding of your project's history.

- Don't forget to refer to the [Category 0: Fundamental Git Commands](../about_0.md) section for an overview of all the challenges in this category.

- [Git Documentation - git-log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log)

## Challenge Submission

After completing the challenge, create a new directory inside the "Category_0.6" directory (if not already provided) with a name "Solution" (e.g., "[Solution.md](./Solution.md)"). Inside this directory, include your solution files, such as the Git commands you used and the final state of your Git repository.

You can then commit and push your changes to your fork of the repository. Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or need assistance
